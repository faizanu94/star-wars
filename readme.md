# star-wars

> Star Wars data fetched online from https://swapi.dev

## Key Points

-   The directory **build** contains optimized production build (deployed on Netlify)
-   No polyfills for Internet Explorer
-   Application has been built with **React** and bootstrapped with **npx create-react-app star-wars**
-   Data aggregation of characters is achieved through RxJS
-   Redux is used for application state management
-   Bootstrap is used for designing components

## Running the Application

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faizanu94/star-wars.git
```

Install the application dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Serve the application â€“ this will serve the application on default port 3000

```bash
yarn start
```

Build the application for production

```bash
yarn build
```

## Server Details

> Find the details the application server

-   Data is fetched from third party source (https://swapi.dev/) through APIs
-   No Authentication required (API limit might exceed)
-   HTTP GET Method is used only on data sets fetched from API

## Architecture Details

> Find the details about several pieces of the application listed below

-   `/public` contains static assets
-   `/src` contains application building blocks
-   `/src/components` contains components building up the whole applications
-   `/src/containers` application containers using the components
-   `/src/redux` application state management

## Assumptions

-   API limit exceeding is not supported (should be achieved by adding a verified key page)
-   Internet Explorer support is not required (should be acheved by adding pollyfills)

## What is missing or could be improved?

-   Layout is quite simple, more effects would provide better user experience
-   Mobile first approach to target mobile devices
-   Search suggestions on user inputs
-   Real time data updates (not practical use case as movies / characters data is mostly static)
-   There should have been unit and e2e tests
